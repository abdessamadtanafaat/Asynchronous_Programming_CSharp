General Summary:
This program simulates an order processing system in an e-commerce environment. It includes the following key components and processes:

OrderState Class:

Holds the state of each order (ID, status, and description).
IOrderTask Interface:

Defines the Process method, which will be implemented by each task (validation, packing, and shipping).
ValidateOrder, PackOrder, ShipOrder Classes:

Each class implements the IOrderTask interface and defines the corresponding step (validation, packing, and shipping).
They each simulate processing by updating the order status and printing messages to the console, with Thread.Sleep(1000) simulating a processing delay.
OrderProcessor Class:

Coordinates the execution of order tasks in parallel using ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem to run each task asynchronously.
It uses a CountdownEvent to synchronize and wait until all tasks for an order have been completed.
Main Program:

Initializes the tasks (ValidateOrder, PackOrder, ShipOrder) and a set of orders.
It processes each order in parallel and waits for the tasks to complete using CountdownEvent.
Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Parallel Processing: Tasks are processed concurrently using the ThreadPool, allowing multiple orders to be processed simultaneously.
Synchronization: The CountdownEvent ensures that the main thread waits for all tasks (validation, packing, and shipping) to complete before printing "All orders processed."
Task Management: Tasks are abstracted using the IOrderTask interface, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), where each class handles a single order processing step.
